# python-loadbalncer
Building a loadbalancer from scratch


# Description
---
### What is a loadbalancer? 
 - A load balanceer is a device that sits between the user and the server group and acts as an invisible facilitator, encuring that all resource servers are used equally. 

### Motivations
- For slaps,giggles, and learning. I want to build things that sound interesting to me. Along the way I hope to learn something useful. 
- To become well versed in software development

# Project Goals
---
 At the completion of the project I hop to have the following things 
 1. Run a basic server that can listen to "http" requests. 
 2. Create multiple servers that the http server can talk to 
 3. Create a load balancer that can redirect requests to one of the backend servers 
 4. create logic that allos for the routing of multiple requests
 5. create logic to handle if one of the backend servers go down
